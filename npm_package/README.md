# Vendetta Typings

These are the type definitions for Vendetta.

You can install the package using `npm install vendetta-types`.

Given you have configured everything correctly, they _should_ work.

However, if they do not, please add the following to the top of your TypeScript file:

```ts
/// <reference path="path/to/node_modules/vendetta-types/defs.d.ts" />
```

# NOTE

If you are viewing this README from our TypeDoc website, please note that the documentation displayed here may be ahead of the NPM package.
